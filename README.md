# Who is involved with the Development?
This project was initially started by Jkobb Olguin, and members are added to the project on a basis of skill, problem solving, and trust of the individuals in question
before a member is added, the previous contributors to the project will be notified, and a vote will be taken. If one of the members has justified and legitimate concerns involving the integrity, skill, or general demeanor of the individual, they will be taken under review and a vote will be called amongst the neutral members of what action to proceed forward with.
# To Do list:
 - [ ] Read in code
 - [ ] Execute it with a variable clock speed
 - [ ] Begin to display the CPX in a window
    - [ ] add a display for the various leds
    - [ ] update that in with every clock cycle
 - [ ] Allow for additional inputs, such as temperature, gyroscope, and touch to be used through the keyboard
    - [ ] Touch keys will use the keyboard
